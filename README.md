This repository hosts the original for all key experiments presented in the aforementioned manuscript. It has been made publicly available to address concerns regarding data reliability and to uphold the principles of scientific reproducibility, as raised during the peer-review process.

1.Tensile Test Data Description: Original engineering stress-strain curves obtained from tensile testing. File Format: xlsx` Naming Convention: attachment1_W1-W4 repaired specimen.xlsx attachment3_W1 + F3 repaired specimen.xlsx

2.Average grain size values Description: The statistical data of grain size (including average diameter and standard deviation) were measured by electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), and the area and equivalent circle diameter of each grain were automatically extracted by OIM (Orientation Imaging Microscopy, 7.2) analysis software, and calculated by area weighted average method.
